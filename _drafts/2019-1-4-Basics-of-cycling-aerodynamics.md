As the title of the post says, I'm going to talk about the basics of what makes us go faster on the bike. I specifically stayed away from using aerodynamics because, while aero is a big component of going fast, it is not the only one and there are a other factors worth discussing and learning about.

Why am I writing about this? I chose this topic as my first post here not because I believe this is the single most important aspect of triathlon or cycling racing performance. I chose aerodynamics because it's something I'm really interested in at the moment and writing about it will help me crystalize my ideas on the subject and share the knowledge I gained through my own experience research and experimentation with others that might benefit from it. It's also the triathlon off-season and like every other year this is the time to make changes, try new approaches and focus on different areas of improvement. 

Assuming riding on flat terrain, there are three major factors at play which together make up the total resisting force we need to overcome in order to move forward : aerodynamic drag or wind resistance, tire rolling resistance and mechanical drag or drivetrain loss due to bearing friction. 

### Aerodynamic Drag

Air resistance is the largest of the three making up almost 90% of the total opposing force we need to overcome with each pedal stroke. This makes it very easy to see why aerodynamics is such a big concern at the top levels of sports such as triathlon or cycling and there is a multi million dollar industry built around marketing products and equipment designed to reduce aerodynamic drag. 

### Rolling Resistance

### Mechanical Drag
