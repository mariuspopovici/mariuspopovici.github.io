I'm in the process of trying to determine my tire / rim setup for the coming 2019 racing season. For the last three seasons I've been running Continental Supersonic 23c tires on my previous setup (FLO 60 Carbon Clincher / Al-Carbon Disc) and recently I've switched to a HED Jet+ 6 Black front / HED Jet Plus Disc Black rear combo. I use Vittoria latex tubes and most recently I've been using the new [Silca latex tubes](https://amzn.to/2VD8zCR) with Aluminum valves.

HED Jet+ tires are very wide rims with a 21mm internal width and 25mm external width. Tire choice is not as intuitive to figure out on these wheels and also pressure needs to be lower than on classic narrow rims. What happens when you mount tires on wide rims is that they tend to balloon in size from their nominal width by up to 2-3 or 4mm. In general, for maximum performance you are looking at two things when it comes to tire choice:

- Aerodynamics
- Rolling Resistance

Aerodynamics is influenced by two factors. One of them is how well the tire fits with the rim it's being mounted on. Generally it is best to abide by the [105% rule](https://silca.cc/blogs/journal/part-5-tire-pressure-and-aerodynamic) which says that the rim must be at least 105% the width of the tire in order for it to perform aerodinamically at its best. The other factor is tire aerodynamics or tire tread texture. In general, certain tread patterns tend to have a better Cd (drag coefficient) than tires with a perfectly smooth profile.

Rolling resistance is also a very important factor in tire choice. The [difference](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vTm2AQYKeDuabP8Qiv5_AjatJVNYSY_DRBOeFmO3-_8/edit#gid=1567734751) between the smoothest rolling tires and the worst ones can be as high as 10W per tire which translates to 20W total or 6 minutes over the course of an Ironman bike split (112mi). Coincidentally, 6 minutes is about the average time you would spend changing a flat tire so to me it's a no brainer to choose low rolling resistance over puncture protection any day of the week. Keep this in mind the next time you're thinking of racing on those Gatorskins :)

Aerodynamics is more of a consideration for the front wheels which sees more wind. It's not uncommon to use combination of two different tires, one that performs better aerodynamically on the front and a wider, better rolling tire in the rear.

In the end, you need to marry these three factors in order to choose the best tire / rim combination for you: fit / tread aero profile, rolling resistance and puncture protection. To help yourself decide, try an gather as much data as possible in order to make an informed decision. Here are some resources that are available to assist you in making that determination:

- Tom Anhalt's Rolling Resistance tire testing database [link](https://bikeblather.blogspot.com/)
- Bicycle Rolling Resistance tests [link](https://www.bicyclerollingresistance.com/)
- Tire / wheel combo wind tunnel studies such as these:
  - Thomas Gerlach's San Diego Low Speed Wind Tunnel HED Jet+ Study [link](https://www.thomasgerlach.com/2017/06/best-ironman-triathlon-aero-wheelset.html)
  - FLO Cycling's A2 Wind Tunnell / Crr combined testing of a huge array of tires and FLO 60 Carbon Clincher rims [link](https://flocycling.blogspot.com/2016/06/flo-cycling-a2-wind-tunnel-tire-study.html)
- Search Internet forums such as Slowtwitch ([link](https://forum.slowtwitch.com/)) or the UK Time Trialling forum [link](http://www.timetriallingforum.co.uk/)

For me, based on previous experience and research I have narrowed down the following candidates to pair with my new HED Jet Black Wheels.

- Continental Grand Prix Supersonic 23c (superior rolling resistance, no puncture protection, hard to find especially the previous generation which tested very low Crr)
- Continental Grand Prix Superonic 20c (narrow, superior rolling resistance, no puncture protection, hard to find)
- Continental Grand Prix 4000s II 23c [link](https://amzn.to/2VHQYtM) (very good rolling resistance, puncture protection, aerodynamic tread profile)
- Continental Grand Prix 5000 23c [link](https://amzn.to/2VIqQ1w) (improved rolling resistance over GP4000s, reports that it mounts narrower, improved aero tread profile over GP4000s, puncture protection)

Tires that are great candidates but I have excluded them from the short list:

- Vittoria Corsa Speed (best rolling resistance, very good aero, reports of being pretty difficult to mount on HED Jet+ rims but tubeless ready). Probably the best tire choice going purely by the numbers but supposedly flat prone even in tubeless setup and almost impossible to mount with a tube. Would consider it for short races or time trials where speed is everything.

I will rely on existing rolling resistance tests, published wind tunnel data combined with intuition and good old fashion eye-balling to come up with the best possible combination for me. My own testing will follow a simple protocol:

- Mount tire with Silca latex tube on HED Jet+ rim with stock HED rim tape.
- Inflate 75psi, measure tire width using a [digital caliper](https://amzn.to/2VEzDBL).
- Repeat measurement at 85psi and 95psi.

I will be using my own Specialized floor pump and double check pressure with a [digital gauge](https://amzn.to/2LYYrjr). I will not be testing pressures above 95psi as they exceed the maximum recommended pressure by HED for the Jet+ rims.

I will be documenting my findings in this post over the coming weeks as I find the time to test all the different options.
