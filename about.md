## Hi, I'm Marius

I'm a software engineer and triathlete living in South Florida, originally from Cluj-Napoca, Romania. I write code, swim, bike, run and then come here to write all about it.

I created this site to document things that I learn and that I'm passionate about and share some of it with the world.

### Frontdoor Brag Area

3x Ironman Finisher (10:20 PB), multiple 70.3 distance finishes (4:34 PB), Team USA Triathlon athlete (Long Distance) and several seasons as USA Triathlon All American.
