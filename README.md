# My Blog

This is the source repository for my **Jekyll** based blog published at https://blog.popovici.net

I started this blog to learn about static generators such as Jekyll, Markdown and Liquid and not the least start keeping a journal of thoughts on things that I'm passionate about right now such as triathlon, sports performance and technology.

**Jekyll** is a static site generator that's perfect for GitHub hosted blogs ([Jekyll Repository](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll))

I started from a fork of [Jekyll Now](http://www.jekyllnow.com/) and added some additional features such as pagination, a customized dark theme, font awesome icons etc.

I'm using [Netlify](https://app.netlify.com/) to build, process and deploy updates upon commit into the Github repo.
