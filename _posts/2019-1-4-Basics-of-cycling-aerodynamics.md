As the title of the post says, I'm going to talk about the basics of what makes us go faster on the bike. The first post in the series will tackle cycling aerodynamics and what are some of the most successful strategies of improving performance by reducing aerodynamic drag. While aerodynamics is the biggest component of going fast on the bike it is not the only one and there are a other factors worth discussing and learning about which I will address in future posts.

Why am I writing about this? I chose this topic as my first post here not because I believe this is the single most important aspect of triathlon or cycling racing performance. I chose aerodynamics because it's something I'm really interested in at the moment and writing about it will help me crystalize my ideas on the subject and share the knowledge I gained through my own experience, research and experimentation with others that might benefit from it. It's also the triathlon off-season and like every other year this is the time to make changes, try new approaches and focus on different areas of improvement.

If we assume riding on flat terrain, there are three major forces at play which together make up the total resisting force we need to overcome in order to move forward : aerodynamic drag or wind resistance, tire rolling resistance and mechanical drag or drivetrain loss due to bearing friction.

### Aerodynamic Drag

Air resistance is the largest of the three above making up almost 85% of the total opposing force we need to overcome with each pedal stroke. This makes it very easy to see why aerodynamics is such a big concern at the top levels of sports such as triathlon or cycling and there is a multi million dollar industry built around marketing products and equipment designed to reduce aerodynamic drag.

#### What are the components of aerodynamic drag?

Aerodynamic drag is directly affected by the following three:

- Air Density (calculated from humidity or dew point, air pressure and air temperatures)
- CdA (Coefficient of Drag x Frontal Area = Cd x A)
- Speed or velocity

There are several things we learn from the [drag equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Drag_%28physics%29). First, drag increases in direct proportion to air density and frontal area and second, it rises with the square of velocity. What this means is that a cyclist riding at 20mph experiences an aerodynamic drag that is four times the drag at 10mph (**double the velocity, quadruple the drag**).

So how can you reduce aerodynamic drag in order to go faster while maintaining the same level of effort? Obviously you can't change air density and increasing velocity implies increasing power or effort which may or may not be an option. This leaves **CdA** as your only other way component that you can influence and this is why CdA is the single most important number you need to focus on.

Here are some typical CdA values (lower is better):

| Position Type              | CdA (m<sup>2</sup>) |
| -------------------------- | ------------------- |
| Road Bike (hoods)          | 0.316               |
| Road Bike (drops)          | 0.296               |
| Time Trial Bike (aerobars) | 0.250               |

The numbers above are just averages, some of the most slippery positions can yield CdAs as low as 0.180. For example, world hour record holder Graeme Obree's 1994 position was estimated to be a mind boggling [.1720](https://youtu.be/H3mtbq62NUc) and ended up being [banned by the UCI](https://youtu.be/Hcoj2v8fyf4).

In terms of actual real world numbers, as a rule of thumb, at 30mph a CdA of 0.005 is worth about 5W in power or 0.5 s/km.

#### How is CdA Measured?

Typically, an accurate measurement of CdA can be made using wind tunnel testing, however there are ways in which a fairly close estimate of CdA can be made using field testing by using power, speed, rolling resistance, mass and air density measurements. This is actually a very interesting area that I'm currently exploring and experimenting with myself and I plan to write a post about it in the future. 

#### What are some common strategies to reduce CdA?

Again, we need to think about what makes up CdA and that it's the product of the **Coefficient of Drag** and **Frontal Area**.

Coefficient of Drag is given affected by several factors. One of the most important one is shape. Given the same surface area, certain shapes are more aerodynamic than others. [Here](https://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/shaped.html) are some example of different shapes and respective drag values. As you can see, airfoils are some of the best performing shapes in terms of reduced aero drag which is why they are widely used in one form or another in pretty much every modern cycling component that is exposed to the wind (frame tubes, handle bars, hydration systems, seat posts, etc.).

Another factor that affects the Cd in CdA is texture and how it changes air flow in the boundary layer. In most cases a smooth material such as skin will be slower than a textured one such as fabric. A textured material often will disrupt air flow at the boundary layer which at cycling speeds has the effect of reducing aerodynamic drag. A skin suit that fits tight with no folds and wrinkles will almost always be faster than a loose jersey. A skin suit with a textured material will be [even faster](http://www.cyclingnews.com/news/skys-vortex-generator-skinsuits-questioned-by-tour-rivals-but-permitted-by-commissaires/). Covering up exposed skin e.g. legs with calf sleeves is also a good strategy and [shaved legs](https://youtu.be/DZnrE17Jg3I) will almost always be faster than hairy legs. Sorry Chewbacca... that fur needs to go!

Another example of aerodynamic texture implemented are golf balls which being spherical are inherently a less efficient shape compared to an say an airfoil. Adding those little [dimples](https://youtu.be/2B_bkDOnwJY) on the surface of the ball however has the effect of improving it's drag coefficient by tripping air flow at the surface and reducing pressure drag in the wake (pressure that sucks the object backwards and slows it's movement).

Another way to improve CdA and probably the most effective on is reducing frontal area. When it comes to reducing frontal area the human body or the rider itself makes up about 75% of the frontal area that is exposed to the wind so it's not surprising that one of the most succesful strategies of reducing CdA is actually reducing rider frontal area through changes in body positioning. **A lower, narrower position is a guaranteed way of reducing overall CdA** by reducing the A component and overall CdA. A good bike fit that is both comfortable, promotes a low frontal area and does not impede the rider's ability to produce power is **the** key to going faster and **this should be the first thing you need to address** before moving on to other strategies that will most likely yield considerably less gains and be a lot more costly in terms of money spent.

If we had to rank drag reducing strategies from the "biggest bang for your buck" to the "marginal gains" ones they would probably look like this:

- Body positioning (bike fit - low, narrow, head position)
- Equipment
  - Skin suit (well fitting with no folds or wrinkles, textured materials are better)
  - Aero bars (allowing a low, narrow position which minimizes frontal area)
  - Helmet (aerodynamic helmet, which fits well and complements the rider's body position)
  - Wheels (deep section front wheel, disc rear)
  - Hydration set up (aerodynamic shaped bottles, bottles placed between the arms or behind saddle well hidden from the wind)
  - Shoe covers (no buckles or large straps flapping in the wind)
  - Bike frame

Notice how far down the list is bike frame? Yes, if you already own a fairly modern time trial bike, upgrading to the latest $15,000 superbike will not only cost you $15,000 but the extra speed you get will be in marginal gains territory. It's hard to believe but bike frame design has evolved so much in the last ten years or so that the differences between entry level frames and the newer most expensive designs are really quite small. This was recently put to the [test](https://www.slowtwitch.com/Tech/Triathlon_Bikes_in_the_Age_of_Peak_Aero_6429.html) as part of a quite interesting wind tunnel study which compared an entry level bike (Felt B16) with the likes of Cervelo P5X which costs close to $15,000. You can decide for yourself if reducing the equivalent of 200g of drag or if 10W of power savings or roughly 40 seconds over 40k (at 30mph) is worth investing $15,000 when you can get similar or higher gains with slight adjustments in body position, a better fitting helmet or careful setup of hydration and nutrition on the frame.


I hope this gives you a basic starting point to explore the interesting world of cycling aerodynamics. Understanding these basic concepts is the first step to making wise position and equipment choices which in turn will make you faster on race day.

Stay tuned for future posts in this series where I tackle the basics of rolling resistance and mechanical drag or drivetrain friction which should complete the picture of what make you go fast on the bike!
